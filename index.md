## Write a Story

TaleTime relies on writers writing stories! If you want to contribute, the following information is for you.

The the open-source tool *[Twine](http://twinery.org)* is used to create stories. *[Here](https://twinery.org/wiki/twine2:guide)* you can find a useful tutorial in case you don't know Twine yet.
After finishing the .twine file the *[twine converter](https://github.com/TaleTime/Converter)* is used to receive a .json file, which is then used by the actual TaleTime app. 


## Contributing

Since this is an open source project, everyone can help making TaleTime better. You will find the complete source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/TaleTime/TaleTime), where you can also get some more information on how to contribute.

When implementing a new feature or fixing a bug, please make sure that your code follows the same style as the existing codebase and try writing your code as understandable as possible. You should also test your changes and only commit them if they don't break anything. Your comments should be in English.
