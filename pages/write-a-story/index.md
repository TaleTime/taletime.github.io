## Write a new Story

TaleTime relies on writers writing stories! If you want to contribute, the following information is for you.

The the open-source tool *[Twine](http://twinery.org)* is used to create stories. *[Here](https://twinery.org/wiki/twine2:guide)* you can find a useful tutorial in case you don't know Twine yet.
After finishing the .twine file the *[twine converter](https://github.com/TaleTime/Converter)* is used to receive a .json file, which is then used by the actual TaleTime app.
